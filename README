##Introduction

YobbinCallouts is a project I started in summer of 2020 to provide a wide range of unique callouts all around the map, that have never been done before. The project started with just two callouts with extremely poor code efficiency and style, to now including over a dozen callouts that have improved greatly as my coding skills have improved. Of course, it is well known that I am a pretty bad programmer (lmao), so please excuse poor style or code efficiency.

As of July 29, 2022, the project is now entirely open-source to help others with their own LSPDFR plugins, as well as for interested (and lovely) people to contribute to the project. If you'd like to contribute, please continue reading! Thanks!

##Quick guide around the project

###Main.cs

This is the EntryPoint for the LSPDFR plugin. Not very interesting, there is an update checker (thanks albo!) that still works even though I haven't changed it in years xD.

###CallHandler

This class is probably the most interesting if you're looking through my code to use for your own. The class contains a variety of
useful helper functions that you can easily incorporate into your own LSPDFR/RPH plugins by simply copy/pasting. Functions include:

`Vector3 GetHouse(float maxdistance = 600, float mindistance = 100)`
Gets a random house from an existing ArrayList of houses all around the map, within mindistance and maxdistance (both are optional). If no house is found in that range, `IsHouse` will return as false, and a random street position maxdistance away will be chosen instead.

`Vector3 GetHospital(float maxdistance = 600, float mindistance = 100)`
Gets a random hospital from an existing ArrayList of hospitals all around the map, within mindistance and maxdistance (both are optional). Works the same as GetHouse.

`Vector3 GetStore(float maxdistance = 600, float mindistance = 100)`
Gets a random store from an existing ArrayList of stores all around the map, within mindistance and maxdistance (both are optional). Works the same as GetHouse.

`void Dialogue(List<string> dialogue, Ped animped = null, String animdict = "missfbi3_party_d", String animname = "stand_talk_loop_a_male1", float animspeed = -1, AnimationFlags animflag = AnimationFlags.Loop)`
Plays a dialogue in "List<string>" form
